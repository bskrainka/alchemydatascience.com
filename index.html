            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Our founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-skrainka">Benjamin S. Skrainka</a>, has been a data scientist since long before data scientists roamed the earth. As an undergraduate, by writing software to study the curvature of space-time geometry and crater relaxation on icy moons, he realized that software engineering was a fundamental tool for modern science. Consequently, he chose to learn software engineering in the challenging Silicon Valley startup community before pursuing a PhD in Economics. Today, he brings the toolkits of social and natural science as well as machine learning to bear on relevant applied problems, backed by industrial-strength engineering methods.</p>
          </div>
          <p>We understand that successful data science projects must solve the right problem to the appropriate degree of accuracy and also be deployed in your technology ecosystem on-time and on-budget. Consequently, our approach combines the industry leading data science workflow with a framework for evaluating model correctness. And, we drive this project using whichever software engineering methodology you prefer. This approach produces good results which solve the right business question <i>and</i> actually work in the real world.</p>

      <h2>WE BELIEVE IN GREAT SCIENCE</h2>
      <p>Great science depends on good workflow, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining">CRISP-DM</a>, to ensure consistency and reproducibility &mdash; from solving the right business problem to appropriate models to deployment. By focusing on the business problem first, we identify the best modeling strategies and metrics to create a successful solution.</p>
      <p>Great science achieves correctness through <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/verification-and-validation-in-scientific-computing/05CA1F8F3CCB5AE5445FDF55239A0183"> verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VV&UQ).</a> VV&UQ provides a framework to check that code works correctly and that models have high fidelity with reality.</p>
      <p>Great science is built by using modern software engineering methodologies such as Agile or Kanban. These methodologies make sure that progress can be tracked and that data science projects produce the right solution.</p>
      <p>We combine these three frameworks, each of which is necessary for success, to produce great science-driven results for our clients.</p>
